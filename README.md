## About the MSP430 Platform

The MSP430 is a mixed-signal microcontroller family from Texas Instruments. The code in this repository is written in the MSP430 assembly language, which uses the instruction set specific to this microcontroller architecture.

## Environment Setup

To work with these assembly files, you'll need:

1. **IAR Embedded Workbench for MSP430** or **Code Composer Studio**
2. **MSP430 Development Board** (optional for physical testing)

## Key Learning Outcomes

Through these assembly programming labs, I've learned:

- Basic assembly language syntax and structure
- Memory addressing modes in the MSP430 architecture
- Register operations and CPU flags
- Implementation of basic algorithms in assembly
- Optimization techniques for assembly code
